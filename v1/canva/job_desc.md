About the Group and Team

Join the DevX (Developer Experience) group at Canva, where our goal is to empower engineers to do their best work. We are creating a new team called AI Developer Tooling Workflows that is dedicated to accelerating Canva's engineering velocity by evolving beyond standalone AI tools into AI tooling paved paths, orchestrated agentic frameworks and embedding intelligent AI capabilities across the entire software development lifecycle.

Our mission is to reduce developer toil and unlock step-change improvements in productivity by providing engineers with AI-powered workflows that are contextually aware, seamlessly integrated, and continuously improving.
